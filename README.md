### INSTRUCTIONS 
1. Watch the short video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8y_e6t0G4 (limegl0wstix, 
2010), and carefully watch how the user interacts with the toy.

2. Download the provided .zip file (includes HTML, CSS, and JS), extract the contents, then 
open the HTML file in a browser and click on the button. 

3. Edit the HTML file to include 5 buttons – each one will pick a random phrase from a 
JavaScript array (use the image on the last page of this assignment to build each of the five 
arrays). Note that the first column is a list of nouns (forming the sentence subject), the second is 
a list of verbs, the third is a list of adjectives, the fourth, another list of nouns, and the fifth 
consists of a number of places (or settings). 

4. The user will push each of the buttons, and each will concatenate the random word from its 
array, eventually building the text string. 

5. Create a new button (already built for you. You have to develop on-click functionality) that 
will create a random story from the array. 

6. Also, dynamically add your student id/name using any function and on click listener. 

7. Once you’ve completed the functionality of the interface, add some CSS to make the page 
visually attractive (don’t spend too much time on this – the focus is the JS).
